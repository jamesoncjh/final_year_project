# Final Year Project

# Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a social sports system that allows users to connect, plan events, and engage with their sport interests. 
Users will be able to plan meetings for team sports like basketball and badminton that need a minimum of players. 
Individuals of any age group, gender, skill level or physical condition are able to join these meet ups to break down barriers to entry and encouraging more people to participate in sports.

# Objectives 
• To develop a social sports system that employs advanced algorithms and interactive features to address the difficulty of finding and connecting with fellow sports enthusiasts. 
• Emphasize user-friendly features in event planning, scheduling, and coordination tools. 
• To integrate event management functionalities, such as real-time notifications, collaborative planning tools, and user-friendly scheduling interfaces. (coming soon)

# Future Work
• Implement backend framework into the project (Laravel)
• Social media-like features (story, posts, add friends, message, etc)
• Implement frontend framework into the project (React)
